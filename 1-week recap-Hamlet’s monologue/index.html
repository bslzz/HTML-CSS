    <h1>Speech: “To be, or not to be, that is the question”</h1>

    <em>"(from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)"</em><br /><br />

    To be, or not to be, that is the question: <br />
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer <br />
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, <br />Or to take arms against a
    sea of troubles <br />And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br />
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end <br />
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks <br />That flesh is heir to:
    'tis a consummation <br />
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; <br />To sleep, perchance to
    dream—ay, there's the rub:<br />
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, <br />When we have shuffled
    off this mortal coil,<br />
    Must give us pause—there's the respect <br />
    That makes calamity of so long life.<br />
